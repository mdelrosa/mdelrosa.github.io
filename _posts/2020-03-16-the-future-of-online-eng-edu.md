title:  "The Landscape of Online Engineering Education"

*This post was written to satisfy the final project requirement for the Winter 2020 offering of ECI289C: Engineering Planning taught by [Dr. Colleen Bronner](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/bronner/).*

As a graduate student wrapping up my coursework, many of my interactions with instructors happen in virtual space. Platforms like Canvas, Piazza, and Slack facilitate distribution of course materials, discussion among course stakeholders, and delivery of assessments to students. Some professors and teachers offer [digital office hours](https://ctl.byu.edu/tip/3-ways-hold-virtual-office-hours) via video conferencing tools (e.g., Zoom, Skype, Google Hangouts).

Given our reliance on online tools for conducting courses, I began to wonder, **"Why can't I earn my engineering degree without ever setting foot in a classroom?"** Offering such online programs could have at least two major benefits:

1. **Accessibility** - As of Q3 of 2019, the sum total of outstanding student loans in the United States was [$1.5 trillion](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/hhdc_2019q3.pdf). Imagine if a student could get an engineering degree from a top accredited program from the comfort of home. In theory, providers of remote learning could funnel funds which typically go into overhead costs (i.e., departmental facilities, dormitories, and dining halls) into crafting better content which can be delivered to a wide audience.
2. **Robustness** - At the time of writing, [135 U.S. colleges have cancelled in-person classes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2020/03/10/at-least-45-colleges-have-cancelled-in-person-classes-so-far-over-coronavirus-fears/#645d0cc54673) due to the coronavirus pandemic. Here at UC Davis, many faculty are scrambling to figure out how to transition to online platforms for administering final exams. Imagine an educational environment that could proceed uninhibited by similar Black Swan events.

Assuming a purely online degree program could make good on the promise of delivering accessible and robust engineering education, that could be a major disruption to the education industry.

In recent years, organizations in both academia and industry have established platforms for online engineering education. There are at least three categories which I would bin these efforts into:

1. Open Education Resources
2. Certification Programs
3. Accredited Degree Programs

This post investigates the viability of these different platform categories by attempting to answer the following questions for each:

1. How effective are online platforms for engineering education?
2. Do these online platforms offer accredited degrees in engineering?
3. Do these platforms make for more accessible and robust educational experiences?

## Effectiveness: To the Research!

Before defining the different platforms, we should address the question: **"Are online tools effective for engineering eduction?"** In *Online Engineering Education: Learning Anywhere, Anytime* [[1]](#r1), researchers from the Sloan Consortium highlighted some research findings on internet-based teaching and learning, including:

- "...no significant difference in learning outcomes for online and on-campus students as measured by test scores... reported over the last decade in the *Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks (JALN)*."
- Self-directed learning approaches (called *constructivist learning* [[2]](#r2)) work well online.
- Faculty and students are pleased with their online teaching and learning experiences.

For the remainder of this post, I will discuss whether or not a given platform offers an accredited degree. **Accreditation** is a process where a degree program submits itself voluntarily to review by an independent evaluation by a board of experts [[3]](#r3). In engineering education, the major body that administers these reviews is the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (known as ABET).

The Sloan paper [[1]](#r1) also touches on how online instuction methods can bolster the student competencies listed in [General Criterion 3 for ABET accreditation](https://www.abet.org/accreditation/accreditation-criteria/criteria-for-accrediting-engineering-programs-2016-2017/) (see Figure 1).

Now, let's focus in on the respective online learning platforms.

## Open Education Resources (OERs)
Open education resources aggregate different [learning objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_object) and make them publicly available free of charge under an open license. The most prevalent example of an OER is MIT's [OpenCourseWare (OCW)](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm), which hosts lectures, course notes, problem sets, and exams from previous offerings of actual MIT courses under the [Creative Commons License](https://ocw.mit.edu/terms/#cc). Video 1 is the fully recorded first lecture from the excellent Linear Algebra course on OCW.

The criterion of accreditation does not really apply here. In themselves, OERs are not  so we can focus on *effectiveness,* *accessibility,* and *robustness.*

The research into *effectiveness* of OERs in student outcomes has been middling, and Grimaldi et. al [[4]](#r4) discuss some of the reasons why. The former, open education resources could serve to bolster in-person teaching and learning, as instructors might include them in "Additional Readings" sections in their syllabi.

The case for *accessibility* of OERs is self-evident; by publishing a large body of freely available learning objects. However, this presumes that all students have access to decent computers and internet connections, which is likely correlated with socioeconomic status (i.e., students from wealthier backgrounds have better technology available than students from less wealthy backgrounds).

Furthermore, merely distributing course materials does not offer the same educational experience that one has in a university classroom. Marc Clarà [[5]]($r5) grounds this notion in developmental psychology through his discussion of Vygotsky's theory of the "Zone of Proximal Development," arguing
> ...*conceptual development is driven only by instruction that promotes the [learner's] formation of nonspontaneous meaning.* 

(Here, *nonspontaneous meaning* can be taken to mean *scientific or mathematical concept*.) We can see that on their own, OERs might fall short in both the departments of effectiveness and accessibility (to instructors), as they do not offer any form of direct instruction.

On the upside, OERs seem to be a rather *robust.* By democratizing learning objects, individuals can engage with materials whenever and wherever they like, allowing for decentralized and asynchronous learning.

## Online Certification Programs

Whereas OERs merely provide materials to students, Online Certification Programs (OCPs) involve interaction between the provider of educational materials and the learners. Furthermore, they offer certifications to those who complete the courses. For example, Udacity is offers paid programs on a range of tech-related topics (e.g., AI, Data Science, and Entrepreneurship).

While OERs often take materials and lectures from in-person classes and merely post them online, the materials for OCPs are often built with online learning environments in mind. Below, Video 2 highlights an example of a learning object from a Udacity course.

OCPs like Udacity typically [do not offer accredited degrees](https://udacity.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015779092-Is-Udacity-an-accredited-educational-institution-). OCPs target market appears to be professionals who want to develop practical, career-oriented skills within their competencies or who want to make a career transition. Indeed, OCPs like [eCornell](https://www.ecornell.com/) offer programs, such as ["Engineering Leadership"](https://www.ecornell.com/certificates/leadership-and-strategic-management/engineering-leadership/) which comes with an "Engineering Leadership Certificate" as well as Professional Development Hours (see Figure 2).

<small>Figure 2: Information on eCornell's "Engineering Leadership" certificate.</small></center>

---

From an effectiveness standpoint, there is not a wealth of published research on OCPs. I suspect most researchers of engineering education  design and carry out their experiments in own respective classrooms, and the set of the instructors of OCPs must not overlap substantially with the set of engineering education researchers. OCPs self-report on the efficacy of their programs by touting the promotions and jobs which their participants secure (e.g., Figure 3).

<center>
<small>Figure 3: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/success">Testimonials</a> on the impact of Udacity programs.</small></center>

---

From an financial accessibility standpoint, these programs have a range of price tags. For example, the average cost of a Udacity "Nanodegree" program is about $1355 (Figure 4). For an established professional with a steady income, this might be affordable, but for less economically advantaged individuals, this might be out of the question. As a another OCP alternative, Coursera offers "specialization programs" which range from $156-$474 total cost (based on monthly rate estimates [available here](http://www.arcytech.org/coursera/)).

---

OCPs seem promising in making engineering education robust against external shocks. In the wake of the COVID19 pandemic, Coursera has [opened up their entire course catalog](https://www.coursera.org/coronavirus) to impacted universities and organizations. If programs and engineering educators find UDPs to be successful in the context of social distancing, more stakeholders might decide to integrate distance learning into their respective programs.

## Online Degree Programs

Finally, let's consider fully accredited online degree programs (ODPs). Many well-established public (e.g., Ohio State) and private (e.g., Columbia) institutions offer ODPs in engineering. With respect to online engineering degrees, the emphasis appears to be on Master's degrees. U.S. News publishes a list of "[Best Online Master's in Engineering Programs](https://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/engineering/rankings?online-program-type=online)," and a search on the 2020 list filtered for "100% Online" returns 76 schools, of which 57 are public universities, 18 are private, and 1 is for-profit. A similar search for "[Best Online Bachelor's Programs](https://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/bachelors/rankings?major=Engineering%2C+General&mode=table)" with the "Engineering, General" filter returns only 5 schools (4 public, 1 private). Another site,bestdegreeprograms.org, claims to have [a list of the 25 best online engineering bachelor's programs](https://www.bestdegreeprograms.org/top-schools/online-bachelors-in-engineering) which they claim to have winnowed down from 85 programs, but they do not produce this full list. 

From an accessibility perspective, ODPs might offer a means for folks living far from population centers to get a solid engineering education (see Figure 5 for some first-order support for this claim).

Less populated states seem more interested in ODPs (<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=online%20degrees&geo=US">interest data</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population_density">population data</a>, made in Excel).</small></center>

---

Deming. et al touch on both questions of financial accessibility of ODPs [[6]](#r6); the 2015 paper claims that schools which are predominantly "Online" have tuition costs which are trending *downward*, which contrasts with in-person schools whose tuition costs have leveled off on average (Figure 6).

<center>
<small>Figure 6: Trends in tuition by institution type <a href="">[6]</a> based on IPEDs data. "Online" schools have over 50% enrollment by "distance" students.</small></center>

---

Furthermore, Goodman et. al [[7]](#r7) demonstrate that an online computer engineering master's degree option at the Georgia Tech provides access to seekers of education from older demographics, writing

> Our causal evidence shows that this online option expands access to education and does not substitute for other informal training... This is the first rigorous evidence that we know of showing that an online degree program can increase educational attainment, implying that the higher education market had previously been failing to meet demand for this particular bundle of program characteristics.

In terms of robustness to external shocks, the same argument applied to UCPs applies to accredited programs. UDPs might suffer more in the wake of Black Swan events, as they likely involve more synchronous activity between instructors and students than do UCPs.

## Coda: Bricks vs. Bits

The premise of this post was to answer the question: **"Why can't I earn my engineering degree without ever setting foot in a classroom?"** I described three types of online engineering platforms, open education resources (OERs), online certification programs (OCPs), and online degree programs (ODPs), which answer this question with "no," "kind of (but no)," and "yes," respectively. Broadly speaking, all of these mechanisms serve to increase accessibility with respect to age, geographic location, and financial cost. Given their distributed nature, these online avenues also make our educational systems more robust to external shocks.

However, which I have skirted around a follow-up question: **"What is an engineering education for?"** In the way that I answered the "effectiveness" question, one might take the ABET criteria as the gospel of educational outcomes for newly minted engineers.

But going to university is not all about gaining technical skills, which (as discussed in this post) can be done online. [Tyler Cowen and Jordan Peterson](https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/tyler-cowen-jordan-peterson-db9a718beebe) discuss some of these intangible benefits for leaving home and attending an in-person program,

> [U]niversities give young people a four-year, socially sanctioned identity that they can adopt while they’re experimenting and trying to mature... Universities give students, young people something to do when they leave home first while they grow up... Universities give people a chance to reconstitute their peer network and emerge as different people. Universities give people a chance to contend with the great thought of the past... To find mentors, to become disciplined, to work towards a single goal. And almost none of that has to do with content provision. - Jordan Peterson

I think if online engineering education is to take off in any meaningful way, educators need to figure out how to provide these intangibles. Programs like the [Minerva Schools](https://www.minerva.kgi.edu/) are examples of what institutions might do to marry a distributed, online educational model with global cultural immersion.

Some engineering disciplines face distinct challenges in making such progressive online programs work, and if we hope to make engineering education effective, accessible, and robust while still exposing young adults to a diversity of worldviews, then we must make them work.
