Having transitioned from a position as an engineer in industry into a PhD program this past September, I have found myself writing more over the span of a few months than I have over the last two years. Whether it be a report fulfilling coursework requirements or a slide deck summarizing another researcher's work, I have found this process academically rewarding.

However, the quality of this content has been highly variable, as it is typically graded and then promptly consigned to the virtual dust bin that is my hard drive. Writing is formalized, structured thinking, and if I continue to write with the intent to let my work collect virtual dust, then the worth of my thoughts will be be commensurate with dust.

To remedy this, I introduce this blog. The posts which I hope to publish on this blog are three-fold: 

1. Posts explaining fundamental concepts related to my academic interests (e.g., machine learning, optimization, wireless communications)
2. Posts documenting projects from classes and from research
3. Posts summarizing interesting papers and attempts at replicating results

Content may bleed over into other topics (neuroscience, psychology, statistics), as I am pushing the boundaries of my academic interests. In whatever domains our interests overlap, Dear Reader, I hope that this blog proves useful to you.
