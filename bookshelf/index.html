    <p><i><a href='https://www.amazon.com/Tribe-Mentors-Short-Advice-World/dp/1328994961'>Tribe of Mentors</a></i>.</p>
    <p>NYT best-selling author, Tim Ferriss, distilled the wisdom from thousands of hours of podcast interviews with titans of industry, academia, and life in general in his most recent book, <i><a href='https://toolsoftitans.com/'>Tools of Titans</a></i>. For his upcoming book, he compiled a list of his most effective questions and solicited responses to those questions via email from his interviewee "reach list," which included, Neil Gaiman, Ayaan Hursi Ali, and the Dalai Lama. <i>Tribe of Mentors</i> is the compilation of the 140 respondents, which includes the likes of Ben Stiller, Yuval Noah Harari, and Terry Crews.</p>
    <p>Tim's work, primarily <i>Tools of Titans</i> in conjunction with his podcast, have helped improve my life immeasurably in 2017. Journaling, meditating, dieting, and exercising are practices which I started doing with fanatic regularity after becoming a follower of Tim's work. I will definitely be picking up a copy of <i>Tribe of Mentors</i> come November.</p>
